## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Updated)

| Variable | Required | Description | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | OpenAI API key for CrewAI agents | Requires GPT-4 access |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Yes* | Tavily search API key | Recommended for best results |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | Yes* | SerpApi search API key | Alternative to Tavily |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | No | Path to Google Cloud service account key | For Firestore |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | No | Flask session secret key | Auto-generated if not set |
| `FLASK_ENV` | No | Flask environment | development/production |

*At least one search API key is required

### Firestore Database Setup (Optional)

The app includes integrated Google Cloud Firestore support for persistent data storage.

#### Quick Setup
1. **Create Google Cloud Project** with Firestore enabled
2. **Create Database** named `ai-biz` in Firestore
3. **Authentication** (automatic - uses multiple methods):
   - **Secret Manager**: Pre-configured to use a secret named `AI-Biz-Service-Account-Key` in your project's Secret Manager. The `build-insight-app.sh` script will grant the necessary permissions.
   - **Service Account**: Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to your service account key path
   - **Application Default**: Run `gcloud auth application-default login`

#### Detailed Setup Guide
See `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions including:
- Google Cloud project configuration
- Firestore database creation
- Authentication setup (service account vs. ADC)
- Security rules and permissions
- Troubleshooting common issues

#### Benefits of Firestore Integration
- **Persistent Storage**: Insights survive app restarts
- **Scalability**: Handles large numbers of insights efficiently  
- **Real-time**: Automatic synchronization across sessions
- **Backup**: Built-in data protection and recovery
- **Analytics**: Monitor usage through Google Cloud Console

#### Current Status: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Firestore Integration**: ✅ Working and saving data
- **Secret Manager**: ✅ Configured to use the `AI-Biz-Service-Account-Key` secret.
- **Database**: ✅ Connected to `ai-biz` database
- **Data Persistence**: ✅ All insights saved and retrievable
- **Download Feature**: ✅ Beautiful HTML report downloads

#### Fallback Behavior
If Firestore becomes unavailable:
- App automatically falls back to in-memory storage
- All features continue to work normally
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging

## 🚀 Production Deployment (2025 Best Practices)

### Using Gunicorn (Recommended)
```bash
# Install with async support
pip install gunicorn[gevent]

# Run with optimized settings
gunicorn -w 4 -k gevent -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --timeout 120 app:app
```

### Using Docker (Multi-stage build)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements-flask.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-flask.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:5000/ || exit 1
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-k", "gevent", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--timeout", "120", "app:app"]
```

### Environment Considerations
- Set `FLASK_ENV=production`
- Use strong secret key for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- Enable Firestore for persistent storage
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Configure rate limiting and request timeouts
