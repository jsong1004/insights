# Social Features Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you add comprehensive social features to your AI Insights Generator, including:

- **Community Page**: Browse all shared insights with sorting (recent, most liked, pinned)
- **Search Functionality**: Search insights by topic or content
- **Like System**: Users can like insights with real-time updates
- **Admin Pinning**: Admins can pin important insights to the top
- **Trending Topics**: Show popular topics from recent insights

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Your Routes

Add the new routes to your `routes/main.py`:

```python
# Add the community and search routes from the social_routes artifact
```

Add the new API endpoints to your `routes/api.py`:

```python
# Add the admin pinning and stats API routes from the social_routes artifact
```

### 2. Enhance Insights Manager

Update your `core/insights_manager.py` with the new methods:

```python
# Add all the new methods from the enhanced_insights_manager artifact
```

### 3. Update Data Models

Update your `core/crew_ai.py` with enhanced social features:

```python
# Replace your GeneratedInsights model with the enhanced version
```

### 4. Create Community Template

Create a new template file `templates/community.html`:

```html
<!-- Use the community_template artifact -->
```

### 5. Update Navigation

Update your `templates/base.html` navigation:

```html
<!-- Add the community link using the navigation_update artifact -->
```

### 6. Update Main Application

Update your `app.py` to include admin context processor:

```python
# Add the admin context processor from updated_app_py artifact
```

### 7. Add Admin Management

Create the admin utilities:

```python
# Add methods to auth/firestore_manager.py from admin_utilities artifact
```

Create the admin management script:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts
# Create scripts/manage_admins.py with the admin management code
```

### 8. Run Database Migration

Run the migration script to add social features to existing data:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_social_features.py
```

### 9. Set Up Firestore Indexes

Add these indexes in the Firebase Console or via CLI:

```javascript
// firestore.indexes.json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "insights",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "is_shared", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "likes", "order": "DESCENDING"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "insights", 
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "is_shared", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "is_pinned", "order": "DESCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "created_at", "order": "DESCENDING"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "insights",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION", 
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "is_shared", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "created_at", "order": "ASCENDING"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 10. Set Up Your First Admin

Grant admin privileges to yourself:

```bash
python scripts/manage_admins.py --grant your-email@example.com --granted-by system
```

## Testing

Test the social features by:

1. **Creating Test Insights**: Generate several insights with different users
2. **Testing Like Functionality**: Like/unlike insights and verify real-time updates  
3. **Admin Testing**: Test pinning/unpinning with admin privileges
4. **Search Testing**: Search for insights by various terms
5. **Pagination Testing**: Create enough insights to test pagination
6. **Mobile Testing**: Verify responsive design on mobile devices

## Performance Considerations

- **Firestore Indexes**: Ensure all required indexes are created
- **Pagination**: Use efficient pagination to handle large datasets
- **Caching**: Consider caching community stats and trending topics
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize any user-uploaded images
- **CDN Usage**: Use CDN for static assets in production
